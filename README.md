  Info about the siilar intrest:
	When we heard the word similar intrest the first idea popped up on all of our mind is travelling. Since we are from different countries
	travelling is the most common thing that everyone would like to follow in order to get releived from stress tight work etc.Hence Travel would 
	be most powerful way to get out from the virtual world and connect us to the natural world.

4.Anything else about the course:
	Having studied in one of the best institutes in our country, I feel the need to expose myself to
	academics and research in Canada which is one of the world leaders in Data Analytics. I have chosen
	St. Maryâ€™s University as the place where I would like to pursue my Master's degree in Computing and
	Data Analytics, because I find courses in the graduate program such as Web, Mobile, and Cloud
	Application Development and UI/UX Design will help me to transit from Backend Web Developer to
	Full Stack Web Developer. In addition to, the course Business Intelligence and Data Visualization will
	add value to my Data Analyst portfolio.
